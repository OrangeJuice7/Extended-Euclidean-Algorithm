# Extended Euclidean Algorithm
An implementation of the [extended Euclidean algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Euclidean_algorithm): Given two positive integers *a* and *b*, the algorithm computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) *gcd(a,b)* of *a* and *b* along with a linear combination of *a* and *b* that is equal to *gcd(a,b)*.
